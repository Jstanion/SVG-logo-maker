## Description

I wanted to test my skills involving modularization and being able to work the flows of multiple files working in tandem to run a successful application. The intent behind this project was to have an application that would provide me with a means of creating my own SVG logo and avoid having to hire someone from outside sources. The application will currently create a basic logo containing three character in any color, placed within a triangle, swuare, or circle of another color. Future development efforts will allow me to build upon this application to provide more options  for dynamically generating an svg logo. I learned the importance of test driven development, specifically how it can save time in debugging when done proficiently. It is particualrly significant when working with object-oriented-programming when multiple code sets can easily break from a change elsewhere.
